Problem 1
---------

Creating a data frame for question 1:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.0.0     ✔ purrr   0.2.5
    ## ✔ tibble  1.4.2     ✔ dplyr   0.7.6
    ## ✔ tidyr   0.8.1     ✔ stringr 1.3.1
    ## ✔ readr   1.1.1     ✔ forcats 0.3.0

    ## ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
hw1_p1_df = tibble(
  random_sample = runif(10, 0, 5),
  vec_logical = random_sample > 2,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c(vec_char))
  
)
```

The mean of random\_sample is 2.1733971.

The mean of vec\_logical is 0.5.

The mean of vec\_char is NA.

The mean of vec factor is NA.

We are only able to calculate the mean of random\_sample and the logic vector. Random\_sample is a numeric variable, so we would expect to be able to calculate the mean. The logic vector is a dichotomous variable that r recognizes as either "1" when "TRUE" and "0" when "FALSE", which is why the mean can also be calculated for this variable. The character and factor vectors have character values, and so a mean cannot be calculated because there is no numerical value.

### Converting Variables with Codechunks

-   Below, I use the *as.numeric* function to the logical, character, and vector variables:

``` r
p1_log_to_numeric = as.numeric(hw1_p1_df$vec_logical)
p1_fact_to_numeric = as.numeric(hw1_p1_df$vec_factor)
p1_char_to_numeric = as.numeric(hw1_p1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

When use the *as.numeric* function, the logical variable is converted to 0 or 1 (1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE). When applied to the character vector, we see a warning message that explains NA was introduced by coercion. The factor variable is assigned a new number for each new character. They are numbered 1 to 10.

-   Next I will convert my character variable to a factor variable and then a numeric variable

``` r
p1_char_fact_numeric = as.numeric(as.factor(hw1_p1_df$vec_char))
```

My variables are converted to numeric and numbered the same as the factor variable described above.

-   Finally, I will convert my factor variable to a character variable and then a numeric variable.

``` r
p1_fact_char_numeric = as.numeric(as.character(hw1_p1_df$vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

I get the same warning message described above. NA is introduced instead of numbers.
